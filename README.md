# odin-landing-page
The goal of this project is to build a copy of a web page from scratch using only a picture [landing-page-reference.png] as reference.

**Link to project:** // TODO: ADD LINK

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This project was built using a reference image of a complete website. This was achieved by working my way down the page and focusing on one section (header, hero, etc.) at a time rather than jumping around different sections of the website. Most of my time was spent on the style.css file trying to get the flexbox containers and items to sit just right.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to plan ahead by drawing a simple diagram of the website on paper first to help me figure out the layout in advance. This gave me a solid jumping off point and helped me start what would've otherwise be a very daunting task. I also learned to keep my code as neat and organized as I can. This project is one of the first I've done to span several days - taking a break and coming back to messy, confusing code wasn't very fun.
